    "pharmacology": "Penicillin G is a penicillin beta-lactam antibiotic used in the treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible, usually gram-positive, organisms. The name \"penicillin\" can either refer to several variants of penicillin available, or to the group of antibiotics derived from the penicillins. Penicillin G has <i>in vitro</i> activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The bactericidal activity of penicillin G results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through penicillin G binding to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). Penicillin G is stable against hydrolysis by a variety of beta-lactamases, including penicillinases, and cephalosporinases and extended spectrum beta-lactamases.",

Despite this, it is important to perform bacterial susceptibility testing before administering this antibiotic, as resistance is a common issue that may affect treatment.   **A note on antimicrobial resistance, pseudomembranous colitis, and hepatotoxicity**  Many strains of Haemophilus influenzae are resistant to erythromycin alone but are found to be susceptible to erythromycin and sulfonamides used in combination. It is important to note that Staphylococci that are resistant to erythromycin may emerge during erythromycin and/or sulfonamide therapy. Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with most antibacterial agents, including erythromycin, and may range in severity from mild to life-threatening. Therefore, the physician should consider this diagnosis in patients with diarrhea after the administration of antibacterial agents.

    "mechanism": "Protein synthesis is essential for survival and functioning of cells, including bacteria. Doxycycline inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by allosterically binding to the 30S prokaryotic ribosomal subunit. The drug blocks the association charged aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) with the ribosomal A site, which is the acceptor site on the mRNA-ribosome complex. Doxycycline ultimately impedes the elongation phase of protein synthesis and halts the production of essential proteins for bacterial survival and functioning.  Doxycycline mediates anti-inflammatory actions by preventing calcium-dependent microtubular assembly and lymphocytic proliferation, thereby inhibiting leukocyte movement during inflammation. It also inhibits nitric oxide synthase, which is an enzyme that produces nitric oxide, an inflammatory signaling molecule.",
    "pharmacology": "Doxycycline and other tetracyclines are mainly bacteriostatic and are thought to exert antimicrobial effects by the inhibition of protein synthesis. They suppress the growth of bacteria or keep them in the stationary phase of growth. Tetracyclines have antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. Cross-resistance of these microorganisms to tetracyclines is a common occurrence.   As it is a highly lipophilic drug, doxycycline crosses multiple membranes of target molecules. Doxycycline shows favorable intra-cellular penetration, with bacteriostatic activity against a wide range of bacteria. Doxycycline also exhibits antiparasitic properties and anti-inflammatory actions. Its anti-inflammatory effects were investigated in various inflammatory skin conditions, such as bullous dermatoses and rosacea.",

    "mechanism": "Clindamycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to 23S RNA of the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome. It impedes both the assembly of the ribosome and the translation process. The molecular mechanism through which this occurs is thought to be due to clindamycin's three-dimensional structure, which closely resembles the 3'-ends of L-Pro-Met-tRNA and deacylated-tRNA during the peptide elongation cycle - in acting as a structural analog of these tRNA molecules, clindamycin impairs peptide chain initiation and may stimulate dissociation of peptidyl-tRNA from bacterial ribosomes.  The mechanism through which topical clindamycin treats acne vulgaris is unclear, but may be related to its activity against _Propionibacterium acnes_, a bacteria that has been associated with acne.",
    "pharmacology": "Clindamycin exerts its bacteriostatic effect via inhibition of microbial protein synthesis. Clindamycin has a relatively short T<sub>max</sub> and half-life necessitating administration every six hours to ensure adequate antibiotic concentrations.   _Clostridium difficile_ associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been observed in patients using clindamycin, ranging in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis and occasionally occurring over two months following cessation of antibiotic therapy. Overgrowth of _C. difficile_ resulting from antibiotic use, along with its production of A and B toxins, contributes to morbidity and mortality in these patients. Because of the associated risks, clindamycin should be reserved for serious infections for which the use of less toxic antimicrobial agents are inappropriate.  Clindamycin is active against a number of gram-positive aerobic bacteria, as well as both gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes. Resistance to clindamycin may develop, and is generally the result of base modification within the 23S ribosomal RNA. Cross-resistance between clindamycin and lincomycin is complete, and may also occur between clindamycin and macrolide antibiotics (e.g. [erythromycin]) due to similarities in their binding sites.  As antimicrobial susceptibility patterns are geographically distinct, local antibiograms should be consulted to ensure adequate coverage of relevant pathogens prior to use.",

    "mechanism": "There are 3 key phases of aminoglycoside entry into cells. The first \u201cionic binding phase\u201d occurs when polycationic aminoglycosides bind electrostatically to negatively charged components of bacterial cell membranes including with lipopolysaccharides and phospholipids within the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and to teichoic acids and phospholipids within the cell membrane of Gram-positive bacteria. This binding results in displacement of divalent cations and increased membrane permeability, allowing for aminoglycoside entry. The second \u201cenergy-dependent phase I\u201d of aminoglycoside entry into the cytoplasm relies on the proton-motive force and allows a limited amount of aminoglycoside access to its primary intracellular target - the bacterial 30S ribosome. This ultimately results in the mistranslation of proteins and disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane. Finally, in the \u201cenergy-dependent phase II\u201d stage, concentration-dependent bacterial killing is observed. Aminoglycoside rapidly accumulates in the cell due to the damaged cytoplasmic membrane, and protein mistranslation and synthesis inhibition is amplified. The necessity of oxygen-dependent active transport explains why aminoglycosides are ineffective against anaerobic bacteria. Hence, aminoglycosides have both immediate bactericidal effects through membrane disruption and delayed bactericidal effects through impaired protein synthesis; observed experimental data and mathematical modeling support this two-mechanism model. Inhibition of protein synthesis is a key component of aminoglycoside efficacy. Structural and cell biological studies suggest that aminoglycosides bind to the 16S rRNA in helix 44 (h44), near the A site of the 30S ribosomal subunit, altering interactions between h44 and h45. This binding also displaces two important residues, A1492 and A1493, from h44, mimicking normal conformational changes that occur with successful codon-anticodon pairing in the A site. Overall, aminoglycoside binding has several negative effects including inhibition of translation, initiation, elongation, and ribosome recycling. Recent evidence suggests that the latter effect is due to a cryptic second binding site situated in h69 of the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit. Also, by stabilizing a conformation that mimics correct codon-anticodon pairing, aminoglycosides promote error-prone translation. Mistranslated proteins can incorporate into the cell membrane, inducing the damage discussed above.",

After administration, metronidazole enters cells by passive diffusion. Following this, ferredoxin or flavodoxin reduce its nitro group to nitro radicals. The redox potential of the electron transport portions of anaerobic or microaerophilic microorganisms renders metronidazole selective to these organisms, which cause nitro group reduction, leading to the production of toxic metabolites. These include N-(2-hydroxyethyl) oxamic acid and acetamide, which may damage DNA of replicating organisms.",
    "pharmacology": "Metronidazole treats amebiasis, trichomoniasis, and giardiasis, exerting both antibacterial and antiprotozoal activities. Metronidazole is an effective treatment for some anaerobic bacterial infections. Metronidazole has shown antibacterial activity against the majority of obligate anaerobes, however, during in vitro studies, it does not demonstrate significant action against facultative anaerobes or obligate aerobes. The nitro group reduction of metronidazole by anaerobic organisms is likely responsible for the drug's antimicrobial cytotoxic effects, causing DNA strand damage to microbes.  A note on convulsions and neuropathy and carcinogenesis  It is important to be aware of the risk of peripheral neuropathy and convulsions associated with metronidazole, especially at higher doses. If convulsions or numbness of an extremity occur, discontinue the drug immediately. Metronidazole has been found to be carcinogenic in mice and rats. The relevance to this effect in humans is unknown. It is advisable to only administer metronidazole when clinically necessary and only for its approved indications.",
